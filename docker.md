Docker Overview
Docker is a container management service. The keywords of Docker are develop, ship, and run anywhere. The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

 How to start docker service
systemctl start docker
 How to check docker service status
systemctl status docker
 How to check docker version
docker version
 How to check more information about docker

 How to check all images available
docker images

 How to check all containers available
docker ps

How to save an image in tar file
docker save <image name> >filename.tar
 How to load an existing an image
docker load <tar file>
docker import file.tar newimage

Explanation about Load /Save import/export and commmit
save works with Docker images. It saves everything needed to build a container from scratch. Use this command if you want to share an image with others.

load works with Docker images. Use this command if you want to run an image exported with save. Unlike pull, which requires connecting to a Docker registry, load can import from anywhere (e.g. a file system, URLs).

export works with Docker containers, and it exports a snapshot of the containerâ€™s file system. Use this command if you want to share or back up the result of building an image.

import works with the file system of an exported container, and it imports it as a Docker image. Use this command if you have an exported file system you want to explore or use as a layer for a new image.

Add below permission if the jenkins is not able to run docker command
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
Optional
Deploy two tier Application on docker
 Clone the repository from github using below command
git clone https://github.com/monbostest/java-code1.git
 Create a war file using(maven image) below command
cd java-code1
docker run -it --rm --name my-maven-project -v "$(pwd)":/usr/src/mymaven -w /usr/src/mymaven maven:3.3-jdk-8 mvn clean install
NOTE You will have a target folder created where your war file will be stored.

 Create a tomcat container
docker run -d -p 8888:8080 tomcat
 Copy the war file to /usr/local/tomcat/webapps using below command
docker cp  /target/<*.war file >dockerid:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps
NOTE Now please if you are able to access your application in your browser

IPaddress:8888/studentapp-2.5-SNAPSHOT/
####### Configuring Backend (MySql Database to store user details)

 Create Mysql Container using below command
docker run -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root mysql:5.6
 Create database
docker exec -it <container-id> sh
mysql -u root -p
create database studentapp;
use studentapp;

CREATE TABLE Students(student_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
student_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
student_addr VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
student_age VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
student_qual VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
student_percent VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
student_year_passed VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (student_id)
);

grant all privileges on studentapp.* to 'student'@'%' identified by 'student@1';

flush privileges;

NOW we are ready with Frontend and backend service .

To make a connection b/w Application with Database you need to install mysql connector in tomcat container.

 use below command to have mysql connector after login to tomcat container
cd lib
wget https://github.com/cit-latex/stack/raw/master/mysql-connector-java-5.1.40.jar 
 Make database entry
apt-get update
apt-get install vim -y
Add the following content just before last line
vim conf/context.xml
<Resource name="jdbc/TestDB" auth="Container" type="javax.sql.DataSource"
               maxTotal="100" maxIdle="30" maxWaitMillis="10000"
               username="student" password="student@1" driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
               url="jdbc:mysql://<IP-ADDRESS-OF-DB-SERVER>:3306/studentapp"/>
 Restart your application container
docker restart <container-id>
Now Verify if you are able to upload the data to your database using application

 convert running container into an image
docker commit <container id>

 check image
docker images
 login to docker hub
docker login
 Create a repository on dockerhub
 Tag your image
 Push your image to dockerhub
