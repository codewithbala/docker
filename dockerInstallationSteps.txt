Installing Docker on Ubuntu is a straightforward process. Below are the steps to install Docker on an Ubuntu system:

Step 1: Update the System
First, update your existing list of packages:


sudo apt-get update
Step 2: Install Prerequisite Packages
Install a few prerequisite packages which let apt use packages over HTTPS:

sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
Step 3: Add Docker’s Official GPG Key
Add Docker’s official GPG key to ensure the integrity of the packages:


curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
Step 4: Add Docker APT Repository
Add the Docker repository to your system's software repository list:


echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
Step 5: Update Package Database
After adding the Docker repository, update the package database:


sudo apt-get update
Step 6: Install Docker
Now, install Docker using the following command:



sudo apt-get install docker-ce
Step 7: Verify Docker Installation
After the installation is complete, check if Docker is installed and running:

sudo systemctl status docker
You should see output indicating that Docker is active and running.

Step 8: Run Docker Without sudo (Optional)
If you want to run Docker commands without needing sudo, add your user to the docker group:


sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Then, log out and log back in to apply the group changes.

Step 9: Test Docker Installation
Finally, test your Docker installation by running a sample Docker container:


docker run hello-world
This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. If Docker is installed correctly, you should see a "Hello from Docker!" message.

That's it! Docker should now be installed and ready to use on your Ubuntu system.
